1. On each row of the history list, add a delete button. When the button is clicked remove the item from the history. Do not attempt to update the result to reflect the new result value with the item removed, but do think about how you would calculate the new result as if the history entry never happened.

2. If the user types in a number less than zero or greater than 10, then display a validation message when add, subtract, multiply or divide are clicked.

3. Ensure it works.
